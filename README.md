### Summary
3D printed case for Keebio Iris Rev.4 PCB

Assumable these using 14mm M3 bolts and nuts (bolts longer than 14mm will stick out and two pieces won't snap together)

Ultra-thin profile, the middle layer is 6.8mm thick and two-piece can be snapped together and held by magnets for easy carry
Added external buttons for easy firmware flashing

I printed the middle layer using translucent filament to get better lighting

Fusion360 file is included for anyone wants to modify themselves
