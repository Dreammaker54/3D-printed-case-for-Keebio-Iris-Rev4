# 3D-printed-case-for-Keebio-Iris-Rev4
Ultra thin 3D printed cases for Keebio Iris Rev.4 PCB, with magnets snapping feature

### Summary:
3D printed case for Keebio Iris Rev.4 PCB\
Assumable these using 14mm M3 bolts and nuts (bolts longer than 14mm will stick out and two pieces won't snap together)\
Ultra-thin profile, the middle layer is 6.8mm thick and two-piece can be snapped together and held by magnets for easy carry\
Added external buttons for easy firmware flashing\
I printed the middle layer using translucent filament to get better lighting\
Fusion360 file is included for anyone wants to modify themselves

Use magnets to snap two pieces togather, note rubber feet are complementary

### You will need:
3D printed parts\
14mm M3 bolts and nuts (Has to be 14mm. Or you have to use spacers if longer than 14.
Shorter won't work)\
12mm by 2mm magnets\
10mm by 3mm rubber feet (3/8" by 1/8")\
super glue\
(optional some needle file)


### Printer settings:
layer height 0.15mm\
Use supports
